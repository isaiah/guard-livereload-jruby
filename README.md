Guard livereload for jruby
==========================

Get started
-----------

This is a drop in replacement for guard-livereload. Instead of em-websocket,
this one uses the java implementation [Java-WebSocket](https://github.com/TooTallNate/Java-WebSocket)

If you use rack-livereload, replace livereload.js with the one in
vendor/ directory.
